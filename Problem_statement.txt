 AI-Driven Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE) 
Context 
Cybercrime investigators often face the challenge of manually verifying the reputation and 
activity of suspicious IP addresses across multiple threat intelligence feeds. Each source 
provides partial information — one may indicate malware hosting, another botnet activity, 
another open ports — but the data is fragmented and inconsistent. 
Problem 
Investigators need a single, consolidated dashboard that can automatically aggregate, 
normalize, and correlate threat intelligence data from multiple public sources to rapidly 
attribute and assess the risk level of an IP address. 
Objective 
Develop a Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE) that can: 
• Automatically query multiple open-source threat intel APIs. 
• Normalize and consolidate data from these sources into a unified reputation profile. 
• Provide a summarized Threat Attribution Report answering key questions like: 
o Is the IP malicious or benign? 
o What categories of threat (botnet, C2, phishing, spam, proxy)? 
o What is its geolocation and ASN? 
o What related domains or URLs are linked to it? 
Constraints / Requirements 
• Can be implemented as a web dashboard, CLI tool, or REST API. 
• Must include a threat scoring mechanism — combine data to produce a final 
confidence or severity score. 
Expected Deliverables 
• Working prototype that accepts an IP address input and outputs a consolidated threat 
profile. 
• Visualization of threat scores, categories, and API results.
